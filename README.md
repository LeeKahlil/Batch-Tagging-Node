# Batch-Tagging-Node

Enter the folder location and tag in the node, start the workflow, and a .txt file with the tag will be created for all the images in the specified folder. 

(Note: the tags of all .txt files are the same, which is suitable for creating text with the same tag or trigger) 

This is the first custom node I wrote. It was created to solve the problem of frequently switching between comfyui and tagging tools when I was training with Lora in comfyui. It is very simple and I hope it can help people in need. Have fun!😊

Installation method:

Download the 'Batch-Tagging-Node-C' file and place it in ComfyUI\custom_nodes
