# Batch-Tagging-Node

Enter the folder location and tag in the node, start the workflow, and a .txt file with the tag will be created for all the images in the specified folder. 

(Note: the tags of all .txt files are the same, which is suitable for creating text with the same tag or trigger) 

This is the first custom node I wrote. It was created to solve the problem of frequently switching tagging files when training with LoRa in ComfyUI. It is very simple and I hope it can help people in need. Have fun!
