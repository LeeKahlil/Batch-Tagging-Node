# Batch-Tagging-Node
Enter the folder location and tag in the node, start the workflow, and a .txt file with the tag will be created for all the images in the specified folder. (Note: the tags of all .txt files are the same, which is suitable for creating text with the same tag or trigger) Have fun!
